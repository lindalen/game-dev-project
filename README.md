# Trying to become a good game developer in ~6 months
This repertoire documents my attempt at the challenge described in this video: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-iST0a69cI.

Why do this?
- To strengthen my C# programming
- To put coding conventions into practise and see why they are important
- To get practical experience with design patterns
- To learn how to finish projects
- To get a feel for what can be done within certain time limits
- To have a project to refer to when applying for jobs

Rules:
- No code should be written before the "timer" has started
- I can create art outside the time limits if necessary (1-hour games for example)
- An incomplete game should be commited as it is. I might commit the necessary changes to make the program run, but not more.
- Any changes made after the time-limit must be tagged "(After time-limit)"
