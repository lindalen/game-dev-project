# game-dev-project
This repertoire documents my attempt at the challenge described in this video: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-iST0a69cI.

Why do this?
- To strengthen my C# programming
- To put coding conventions into practise and see why they are important
- To get practical experience with design patterns
- To learn how to finish projects
- To get a feel for what can be done within certain time limits
